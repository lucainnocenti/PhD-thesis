\chapter{Conclusions}
We discussed machine learning techniques to tackle different quantum information tasks.
On one hand, we showed that borrowing ideas from the machine learning toolbox, such as stochastic gradient descent and automatic differentiation, offers significant advantages for tasks such as gate learning with time-independent Hamiltonians.
Moreover, we found that pairing supervised learning strategies with analytical reasoning we can further speed up finding solutions, and gain more insight into the structure of the problem.
On the other hand, after devising and showcasing experimentally a scheme to generate arbitrary states via quantum walk dynamics, we showed how machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks, principal component analysis, and support vector machines, can provide significant insight into generated states from the sole knowledge of their transverse intensity profiles.
These results add to the growing amount of evidence that the flexibility provided by machine learning finds fruitful application both for fundamental and applied research in quantum information science.
