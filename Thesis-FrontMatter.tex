\tmpHeading{v1}
Quantum information science, and in particular quantum technologies, have seen a significant surge of interest in the last decade.
The field of machine learning saw a similar increase in interest, spurred by several breakthrough achievements~\cite{mnih2015humanlevel,silver2016mastering} which highlighted its potential to tackle diverse problems.
This versatility makes machine learning a promising venue to tackle a variety of problems in quantum information science.
In this thesis, we will discuss a selection of works in which machine learning proved to be a meaningful addition to more standard numerical optimisation tools.
We in particular showcase its usefulness to find time-independent Hamiltonians generating target operations, the so-called \emph{gate learning problem}, and to characterise output states produced by experimental platforms.

\tmpHeading{v2}
In this thesis we discuss applications of machine learning to quantum information science.
The interface between machine learning and quantum information has been the subject of much research, driven by the many successes of machine learning for diverse pattern recognition tasks.
To showcase the benefits of this interdisciplinary line of research, we consider two case studies in which machine learning proves a valuable add-on to more standard techniques used in the context of quantum technologies.
First, we study the problem of devising time-independent dynamics implementing target quantum operations.
This involves a challenging optimisation task, which is hard to tackle with standard numerical tools.
We demonstrate how adapting supervised learning algorithms can dramatically speed-up this task.
We then consider the tasks of engineering and characterising quantum states in the orbital angular momentum and polarisation degrees of freedom of light.
We devise a protocol involving quantum walks to implement arbitrary states by only making use of q-plates to couple polarisation and orbital angular momentum.
This protocol relies solely on the properties of quantum walk dynamics, and is therefore applicable to different types of architectures.
We then present an experimental demonstration of this engineering strategy, and consider the issue of assessing the quality of the states thus generated.
We show how different machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning ones, are able to tackle this problem and provide useful information in realistic experimental conditions.
