The file accuracy_history.txt contains the data to generate the figure with the training history of accuracy and validation accuracy used in the VVB+ML chapter. The figure is generated from the file using MMA with:

```
{acc, valAcc} = Import[FileNameJoin@{path, "accuracy_history.txt"}, "Data"];

fig = ListLogPlot[{1 - acc, 1 - valAcc},
	PlotStyle -> {PointSize@0.015}, ImageSize -> 500,
	Frame -> True, 
	FrameStyle -> 
	Directive[Black, Thick, Large, FontFamily -> "Latin Modern Math"],
	FrameLabel -> {"epoch number"},
	PlotLegends -> Placed[{
			Style["inaccuracy", FontSize -> 23, FontFamily -> "Latin Modern Math"],
			Style["validation inaccuracy", FontSize -> 23, FontFamily -> "Latin Modern Math"]
		}, {Left, Bottom}
	],
	GridLines -> Automatic
]
```
